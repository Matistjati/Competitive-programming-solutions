# Solutions various competitive programming problems
I don't always upload the fastest solution for Kattis problems, mostly because they typically become very ugly when micro-optimizing them.
(For example, adding fast input via [blazingio](https://github.com/purplesyringa/blazingio/blob/master/blazingio.min.hpp) and manual loop unrolling
to get GCC to actually autovectorize make the code very ugly).

Before late 2024, I had an unreasonably long template. I might clean up some of those solutions at some point.
